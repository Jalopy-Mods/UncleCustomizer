This mod allows you to customize the Uncle from Jalopy to your likings!

### You can:
* Remove his hat
* Change his jacket color & texture

### How to install
1. Make sure you have [JaLoader](https://github.com/theLeaxx/JaLoader) 1.0.1+ installed
2. Place it into your mods folder (default is `Documents\Jalopy\Mods`)

### How to add a custom "texture"
1. Go to your mods folder, then into Assets, and then into UncleCustomizer.
2. Create a new `.png` file named `UncleJacket.png`, with a size of `1x1`, and fill it with the color you'd like his jacket to be.
3. Enable the setting from in-game
